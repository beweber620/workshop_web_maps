# Build a Leaflet Web Map

Now that we've made a basic webpage, we can add our web map.

## Prepare Your Page

### Load The External Files

In the **head** section of our webpage, we need to add some information that will tell our map how to appear (the CSS file) and where to find the Leaflet package (Leaflet JavaScript file).

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. You can think of this as the parameters that set the way certain objects are displayed in a website. The file we'll load specifically styles the map elements made with Leaflet.

Loading the Leaflet JavaScript file enables our webpage to have access to the functions and tools in the Leaflet Library. For R or Python users, this is similar to loading packages or libraries in your code.  We could save a static version of this library in our website folders and point to that, or we can link to an online version of it, like we have done in the code below.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>UC Davis Campus Cats Map</title>

<!--Load the Leaflet CSS file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha512-xodZBNTC5n17Xt2atTPuE1HxjVMSvLVW9ocqUKLsCC5CXdbqCmblAshOMAS6/keqq/sMZMZ19scR4PsZChSR7A=="crossorigin=""/>

<!--Load the Leaflet JavaScript file -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js" integrity="sha512-XQoYMqMTK8LvdxXYG3nZ448hOEQiglfqkJs1NOQV44cWnUrBc8PkAOcXy20w0vlaXaVUearIOBhiXZ5V3ynxwA=="crossorigin=""></script>
</head>

<body>
<h1>UC Davis Campus Cats Map</h1>
<p>This webmap shows the locations of UC Davis campus community cats.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

Note that in HTML, comments are written like this: `<!-- This is a comment -->`. Comments are information for the coder and don't render on the website.

### Add a Map Div

A `<div>` element defines a section in your HTML document. Our web map needs its own `<div>`. We'll add one inside the `<body>` of the webpage.  Note that the `<div>` has an ID. This will let us create settings and code that apply to this specific `<div>`.  We can define the style of the `<div>` inside the tag (as we have done below) or we could do it in the `<head>` of the document in a `<style>` subsection, or in a separate CSS file.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>UC Davis Campus Cats Map</title>

<!--Load the Leaflet CSS file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha512-xodZBNTC5n17Xt2atTPuE1HxjVMSvLVW9ocqUKLsCC5CXdbqCmblAshOMAS6/keqq/sMZMZ19scR4PsZChSR7A=="crossorigin=""/>

<!--Load the Leaflet JavaScript file -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js" integrity="sha512-XQoYMqMTK8LvdxXYG3nZ448hOEQiglfqkJs1NOQV44cWnUrBc8PkAOcXy20w0vlaXaVUearIOBhiXZ5V3ynxwA=="crossorigin=""></script>
</head>

<body>
<h1>UC Davis Campus Cats Map</h1>
<p>This webmap shows the locations of UC Davis campus community cats.</p>

<div id="mapid" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>

</body>

</html>
```

If you reload your `index.html` file in your browser, you shouldn't notice any difference. If the page doesn't load, however, you'll need to troubleshoot your code. Make sure your tags open and close in the right order.

### Add a Script Section

Finally, we need to add a section to our code to hold the Leaflet JavaScript code we will write to make our map.  Just below your map `<div>` (and inside the **body** section), add open and closed `<script>` tags.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>UC Davis Campus Cats Map</title>

<!--Load the Leaflet CSS file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.css" integrity="sha512-xodZBNTC5n17Xt2atTPuE1HxjVMSvLVW9ocqUKLsCC5CXdbqCmblAshOMAS6/keqq/sMZMZ19scR4PsZChSR7A=="crossorigin=""/>

<!--Load the Leaflet JavaScript file -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js" integrity="sha512-XQoYMqMTK8LvdxXYG3nZ448hOEQiglfqkJs1NOQV44cWnUrBc8PkAOcXy20w0vlaXaVUearIOBhiXZ5V3ynxwA=="crossorigin=""></script>
</head>

<body>
<h1>UC Davis Campus Cats Map</h1>
<p>This webmap shows the locations of UC Davis campus community cats.</p>

<div id="mapid" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;"></div>

<script>

</script>

</body>

</html>
```

## Add A Map

Now we're ready to add a map. We'll make a simple one to start and add more data later.

**Note:** from now on, we'll be working in the `<script>` section, so the code will just show this section to avoid clutter and focus on what's changing in the code.

Inside the `<script>` section, we'll now be writing JavaScript. `//` is how you indicate a comment in JavaScript.  Outside of this section, you'll be writing HTML. It can get confusing sometimes, so have patience with yourself.

First, we'll create an empty map in our mapid div, then we'll load Stamen's Toner tile service to use as a background layer. The limited color palette of the Toner tile service will make it easier to see the data we'll be loading later.

```
<script>

	//add an empty map called "catmap" to the page in the mapid div
	var catmap = L.map('mapid', {
		center: [38.538592, -121.75], 
		zoom: 15
		});

	//add the base map = Stamen Toner tile layer
	var Stamen_Toner = L.tileLayer('https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/toner/{z}/{x}/{y}.{ext}', {
		attribution: 'Map tiles by <a href="http://stamen.com">Stamen Design</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC BY 3.0</a> &mdash; Map data &copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>',
		subdomains: 'abcd',
		minZoom: 0,
		maxZoom: 20,
		ext: 'png'
		});
		catmap.addLayer(Stamen_Toner);

</script>
```

### Add a Marker

Let's add a marker so we can find the Quad. The marker will be a blue inverted teardrop that will have a tooltip that says "Quad" when you hover over it.  At the end of your script section, add: 

```
	//add a marker for the Quad with a tooltip
			//Quad: 38.541162, -121.749371
	var marker = new L.marker([38.541112, -121.749350], { 
		opacity: 1.0   //teardrop marker opacity may be set to zero
		}); 			
		marker.bindTooltip("<b>Quad<b>", {	});
		marker.addTo(catmap);
```
You now have an interactive map with one marker!

Notice how we define the marker, add the tooltip to the marker, and then we have to add the marker to the map.

## Use External Data

Adding markers by hand is great, but if we have a lot of data or something more complex than a few points to add or if we want to prepare our data in a GIS or with a script ahead of time, we probably want to load data from a data file.

There are many ways to load an external data file in Leaflet. We'll look at just one here, but there are ways to work with any of the common file types. Here, we'll use data in geoJSON format.

### About GeoJSON

GeoJSON is a spatial data format based on the JSON format. Because it is text-based, it is human-readable, however, depending on the complexity of the data, you may not want to try to read it in a text editor. Another advantage of using a text-based format is that it can easily be stored in online version control systems like GitHub, as long as a file size isn't too big. This is a nice feature if you want to host your webmap on GitHub Pages.

Any of the major GIS tools or programming languages can convert vector data to GeoJSON format.

### Formatting the Data

Leaflet can't read GeoJSON directly, but to make it work, all we have to do is open the .geojson file in a text editor, add `var varable-name = {` at the beginning of the file, and `}` at the end of the file (we're "wrapping" the data in a variable declaration). Then we save the file with a .js extension (because what we've actually done is written a small JavaScript file).

We've done this for you to create the `campus_cats.js` file, declaring our variable as `campus_cats`.  You can see the GeoJSON structure and the variable declaration if you open the file in a text editor.

### Read the Data

To read the data into our webpage, we need to add another short script section, just above the one we've been working in that calls our `campus_cats.js` data file.

```
<script src="campus_cats.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Now the data in this file will be available to load into our map.

### Add Data to the Map

This is the moment you've been waiting for! We'll add data from our external data file to the map.

Add this code to the bottom of your long script section (below where we made our marker for the Quad and above the closing `</script>` tag):

```
	//add cat points from the GeoJSON (campus_cats.js) file
		
	var catpoints = L.geoJSON(campus_cats, {  
		pointToLayer: function(feature, latlng){  
			return L.circleMarker(latlng, {color: 'orange', radius: 8}); 
		}
	}).addTo(catmap);
```
We now have many orange circles for our cats (and one for the quad that we added earlier)! 

What does this code do though?

First, we create a variable called "catpoints" using the geojson data which we named campus_cats inside the .js file. Then we create a function called pointToLayer that uses the parameters "feature" (each row in the data) and "latlng" (the geometry) from the geojson data. We make a circleMarker using the latlng variable for the position, and use the style options between the {}s to style the marker the way we want it. In this case, it's organge and has a radius of 8 (which is a little smaller than the default). Finally, we add the entire set of markers we built to the map (remember that we called our div that holds our map "catmap").

### Add a popup

It would be nice to have some information available for each marker. Let's make a popup that tells us about each cat.  We'll start with a text popup and gradually add more to it.

We made our markers for our point locations by iterating over the list of features in our dataset and making a marker for each of them.  We can add a function to the one we already have so that once the markers get made, each will get a popup.

We'll modify our code that adds our points to look like this: 

```
	//add cat points from the GeoJSON (campus_cats.js) file
		
	var catpoints = L.geoJSON(campus_cats, {  
		pointToLayer: function(feature, latlng){  
			return L.circleMarker(latlng, {color: 'orange', radius: 8}); 
		},
		onEachFeature: function(feature, layer){
			layer.bindPopup("This is a popup!");
		}
	}).addTo(catmap);
```

What did we do? After the `pointToLayer` function, we added a new created a new function called OnEachFeature that uses the feature (each row of the data) and the layer information. For each feature, we have it bind a popup to our layer (named catpoints) and put the text that is in the parentheses into the popup. For now, all of our popups will say "This is a popup!". We'll build on that next.

### Customize Popup Text with Data

This is progress! We have a map with points and popups that contain placeholder text. Let's use the attribute data from our catpoints layer to add the name of each cat to the popup.

Instead of the "This is a popup!" text, we can use the attribute data from our catpoints data. Replace the current text with: `feature.properties.Name`. As we loop through each row of our data, the code will add each cat's name to the popup.

What if we want to give the popup more context?

The text for the popup can be plain text, but we can also use HTML to style the text like a very small webpage. (If your head is starting to spin from switching languages... HTML page containing JavaScript containing HTML... this is normal.) We'll start small and build up to something more complex.

Maybe we want to indicate that the text in the popup is the name of the cat.  We can concatenate (paste together) some text with HTML syling with our code to get the cat names: `"<b>Name: </b>" + feature.properties.Name`

Our popups are starting to be much more useful!

Ready to get a little more complex? Let's add a description of the cat.  We can use `<br>` to create a line break and put text onto a new line: `<b>Name: </b>" + feature.properties.Name + "<br><b>Description: </b>"+ feature.properties.details)`  This gets harder to read the longer it gets, so sometimes it helps to write the HTML pieces on separate lines, and once you're ready to run it, put all the text onto one line.

Finally, we have a column that has a picture of each cat. Let's put that at the top of the popup. The `<img>` tag will add an image to our popup. `"<img src='"+feature.properties.gx_media_links+"' width='259'><br><b>Name: </b>" + feature.properties.Name + "<br><b>Description: </b>"+ feature.properties.details'

Here's what the section of our code that adds the catpoints marker should now look like: 

```
	//add cat points from the GeoJSON (campus_cats.js) file
		
	var catpoints = L.geoJSON(campus_cats, {  
		pointToLayer: function(feature, latlng){  
			return L.circleMarker(latlng, {color: 'orange', radius: 8}); 
		},
		onEachFeature: function(feature, layer){ 
			layer.bindPopup(
				"<img src='"+feature.properties.gx_media_links+"' width='259'><br><b>Name: </b>" + feature.properties.Name + "<br><b>Description: </b>"+ feature.properties.details); 
		}
	}).addTo(catmap);
```
