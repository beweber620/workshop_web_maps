# Introduction

## What is a "Web Map"?

The term "web map" typically refers to a map embedded in a webpage. The map allows the user to interact with the data in some way. Often, the user can pan and zoom to adjust the view and click on data markers to learn more information about a location.


## Why make a web map?

Web maps can be a powerful way to share spatial information with other people, especially when you expect the viewer to want to explore the data in different ways. Web maps allow the user to customize their experience in ways that a static map cannot.

Web maps can also be a more engaging way for your audience to learn about a topic of interest.

Web maps can also be a way to interact with a community of interest, enabling a reasearcher to both share and collect spatial information from a community.

## Workflow

To make an online interactive web map, we'll need to complete several steps. Typically these are:

1. Make a webpage to contain the web map code
2. Write the web map code and put it into the webpage
3. Put the web page online

## Leaflet

In today's workshop, we'll be using a javascript library called [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/index.html) to write the code that will make our web map.  Leaflet is a popular open source javascript library specifically designed to build interactive web maps with a combination of data available online (like tile services for basemaps) and your own data. Leaflet is well-documented and has [excellent tutorials](https://leafletjs.com/examples.html) to illustrate common tasks and innovative uses of the tool. In addition, there is an active community using this tool so there is ample support on online message boards and social media outlets.
