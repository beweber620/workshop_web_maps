Learners with previous experience with coding in HTML and javascript will have an easier time learning, but these skills are not required.

The term web map typically refers to a map embedded in a webpage. The map allows the user to interact with the data in some way. Often, the user can pan and zoom to adjust the view and click on data markers to learn more information about a location. 1.2 Why make a web map? Web maps can be a powerful way to share spatial information with other people, especially when you expect the viewer to want to explore the data in different ways. Web maps allow the user to customize their experience in ways that a static map cannot. Web maps can also be a more engaging way for your audience to learn about a topic of interest. Web maps can also be a way to interact with a community of interest, enabling a reasearcher to both share and collect spatial information from a community. 1.3 Examples 1.4 Workflow To make an online interactive web map, well need to complete several steps. Typically these are: Make a webpage to contain the web map code Write the web map code and put it into the webpage Put the web page online "],["setting-up-your-file-structure.html", "2 Setting Up Your File Structure 2.1 Download the Data 2.2 Folders 2.3 Files", " 2 Setting Up Your File Structure Before we do any coding, lets set up our file and folder structure. 2.1 Download the Data 2.2 Folders Using your computers file browsing program, navigate to a folder you want to work in. In that folder, create a new folder to hold your files for this project, such as my_web_map. Inside that folder, create another folder called docs. docs will hold the HTML and javascript files that will create our web map. Your folder structure should now look like this: my_web_map |-- docs 2.3 Files Move the data you downloaded for this workshop called campus_cats.js into the data folder. Open your preferred text editor application. Create a new, blank file. Save it inside your docs folder and call it index.html. This will be the homepage for our web site that will hold our web map. Your folder and file structure should now look like this: my_web_map |-- docs | |-- campus_cats.js | |-- index.htm "],["build-a-webpage.html", "3 Build a Webpage", " 3 Build a Webpage The first step in building a web map is to make a basic webpage to house our map. It doesnt need to be elaborate to get started. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
