# Setting Up Your File Structure

Before we do any coding, let's set up our file and folder structure.

## Download the Data

## Folders

Using your computer's file browsing program, navigate to a folder you want to work in. In that folder, create a new folder to hold your files for this project, such as "my_web_map". Inside that folder, create two more folders: "data" and "docs".  "data" will hold the data for our web map and "docs" will hold the HTML files that will create our web map.

Your folder structure should now look like this:

```
my_web_map
|-- data
|
|-- docs

```

## Files

Move the data you downloaded for this workshop into the "data" folder.

Open your preferred text editor application. Create a new, blank file. Save it inside your "docs" folder and call it 'index.html'. This will be the homepage for our web site that will hold our web map. 

Your folder and file structure should now look like this:

```
my_web_map
|-- data
|   |-- campus_cats.js
|
|-- docs
|   |-- index.htm

```
